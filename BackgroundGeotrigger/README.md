# ios-background-geotrigger

This code sample demonstrates monitoring Geotriggers in the background on iOS.

![ios-background-geotrigger](ios-background-geotrigger.png)

## Features
* Geotriggers - Monitor device location as it enters and exits areas of interest

## Instructions

1. Fork and then clone the repo.
2. Set your API Key* in the `AppDelegate.application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method.
3. Ensure that you have set up for background location updates:
  * Ensure you have permission to access the user's current location while the app is in the background by adding this [Property List Key](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nslocationalwaysandwheninuseusagedescription). Read [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/choosing_the_location_services_authorization_to_request) about choosing the location services authorization to request.
  * Turn on "Location Updates" in Background Modes in your project. If you don't see Background Modes under Signing & Capabilites then you need to add that capability using the "+ Capability" button under Signing & Capabilites.
  * Ensure you have set the `CLLocationManager.allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates` property to true.
    * In the Cocoa API, the `CLLocationManager` is present under `AGSCLLocationDataSource.locationManager`
3. Run the app and accept permission requests.
4. Tap on the map to create a graphic which will be used for a fence with a 10 meter buffer.
5. Move the app to the background and observe that notifications are received when the device enters the fence's radius.

* API key: A permanent key that gives your application access to Esri location services. Visit your ArcGIS Developers Dashboard to create a new API key or access an existing API key.
